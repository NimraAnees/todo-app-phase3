# Claude Code Rules

This file is generated during init for the selected agent.

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Your primary goal is to work with the architext to build products.

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps. 

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Project-Specific Configuration: Multi-User Todo Web Application

### Project Overview
Transform a console todo application into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage using the Agentic Dev Stack workflow.

**Development Approach:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow:
1. Write specification (spec.md)
2. Generate architectural plan (plan.md)
3. Break into testable tasks (tasks.md)
4. Implement via Claude Code with specialized agents
5. Review process, prompts, and iterations

**No manual coding allowed** — All implementation must go through Claude Code agents.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16+ (App Router) | React-based UI with server/client components |
| **Backend** | Python FastAPI | RESTful API endpoints |
| **ORM** | SQLModel | Type-safe database operations |
| **Database** | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL | Cloud-native persistent storage |
| **Authentication** | Better Auth | User signup/signin with JWT tokens |
| **Development** | Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus | Agentic spec-driven workflow |

### Specialized Agent Delegation

**CRITICAL:** Use specialized agents for domain-specific work. Never implement these areas directly — always delegate to the appropriate agent.

#### 1. Authentication Agent (`auth-secure-specialist`)

**Use for:**
- User signup/signin flow implementation
- Better Auth integration and configuration
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt/argon2
- Session management and token refresh
- Secure cookie handling (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- CORS/CSRF protection
- Authentication middleware for protected routes

**Authentication Flow (Better Auth + JWT):**
```
User logs in → Better Auth creates session + issues JWT token
Frontend stores token → Includes in Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Backend extracts token → Verifies signature using shared secret
Backend decodes token → Gets user ID, email, etc.
Backend filters data → Returns only resources belonging to authenticated user
```

**Delegation example:**
```
User request: "Implement user authentication"
→ Invoke auth-secure-specialist agent to handle Better Auth setup, JWT configuration, and secure authentication flows.
```

#### 2. Frontend Agent (`nextjs-ui-specialist`)

**Use for:**
- Next.js App Router page creation (app/ directory structure)
- Server Components and Client Components
- Responsive UI layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Reusable React components with TypeScript
- Form validation and error handling
- Client-side interactivity (useState, useEffect)
- Loading states (loading.tsx) and error boundaries (error.tsx)
- SEO optimization and metadata
- Route navigation and dynamic routes

**Delegation example:**
```
User request: "Create a todo list page with add/edit/delete functionality"
→ Invoke nextjs-ui-specialist agent to build responsive UI components with proper App Router conventions.
```

#### 3. Database Agent (`neon-postgres-specialist`)

**Use for:**
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL setup and configuration
- Database schema design (users, todos, categories, etc.)
- Table creation with proper constraints and indexes
- Foreign key relationships
- Database migrations with versioning
- Connection pooling configuration
- Query optimization and indexing strategies
- Neon-specific features (autoscaling, branching)

**Delegation example:**
```
User request: "Design database schema for multi-user todo app"
→ Invoke neon-postgres-specialist agent to create normalized schema with proper indexes and relationships.
```

#### 4. Backend Agent (`fastapi-backend-specialist`)

**Use for:**
- FastAPI application structure and routing
- RESTful API endpoint design (CRUD operations)
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- SQLModel integration for database operations
- Authentication middleware integration
- Error handling and custom exception handlers
- Input validation and data sanitization
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database query optimization
- Dependency injection patterns

**Delegation example:**
```
User request: "Create REST API endpoints for todo CRUD operations"
→ Invoke fastapi-backend-specialist agent to design endpoints with proper validation, auth, and database integration.
```

### Agent Coordination Rules

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent handles its domain exclusively
   - Never mix authentication logic in backend agent work
   - Never mix database schema design in frontend agent work
   - Keep concerns separated per agent specialty

2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Follow this order when building features
   ```
   Database Schema (DB Agent)
   → Backend API (Backend Agent)
   → Authentication (Auth Agent)
   → Frontend UI (Frontend Agent)
   ```

3. **Contract-First Integration**: Agents must agree on interfaces
   - Database agent defines schema → Backend agent uses SQLModel
   - Backend agent defines API contracts → Frontend agent consumes them
   - Auth agent defines JWT structure → Backend agent validates tokens

4. **Agent Invocation Syntax**:
   ```
   Use Task tool with appropriate subagent_type:
   - subagent_type: "auth-secure-specialist"
   - subagent_type: "nextjs-ui-specialist"
   - subagent_type: "neon-postgres-specialist"
   - subagent_type: "fastapi-backend-specialist"
   ```

### Project Requirements (Basic Level)

**Objective:** Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application

1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up with email/password
   - Sign in with JWT token issuance
   - Protected routes requiring authentication

2. **Todo Management (CRUD)**
   - Create new todos
   - Read/list todos (filtered by authenticated user)
   - Update existing todos
   - Delete todos

3. **Data Persistence**
   - All todos stored in Neon PostgreSQL
   - User-specific data isolation
   - Efficient queries with proper indexing

4. **RESTful API**
   - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Proper status codes and error responses
   - Request/response validation

5. **Responsive Frontend**
   - Mobile-first design
   - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Intuitive user interface

### Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Never compromise on these security principles:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Always verify JWT tokens on protected endpoints
   - Match user ID in token with user ID in request URL
   - Filter all database queries by authenticated user ID
   - Never trust client-provided user IDs

2. **Password Security**
   - Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Enforce minimum password requirements

3. **Token Security**
   - Use secure, httpOnly cookies for token storage
   - Set appropriate token expiration times
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Use strong secret keys (never hardcode)

4. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs with Pydantic models
   - Sanitize data to prevent SQL injection
   - Protect against XSS attacks
   - Implement rate limiting

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Store secrets in `.env` file (never commit to git)
   - Required variables: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
   - Use different secrets for development/production

### Development Workflow

**For every feature request:**

1. **Specification Phase** (`/sp.specify`)
   - Document user requirements in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
   - Clarify acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Planning Phase** (`/sp.plan`)
   - Design architecture in `specs/<feature>/plan.md`
   - Identify which agents are needed
   - Define API contracts and data models
   - Suggest ADRs for significant decisions

3. **Task Breakdown** (`/sp.tasks`)
   - Generate actionable tasks in `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
   - Order tasks by dependencies
   - Assign to appropriate specialized agents

4. **Implementation Phase** (`/sp.implement`)
   - Delegate tasks to specialized agents
   - Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) where applicable
   - Verify each task completion

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Create PHR for the session
   - Update ADRs if architectural decisions were made
   - Update constitution if new principles emerged
